# Credit-card_fraud_detection
This project is a machine learning-based solution to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, the model can identify suspicious transactions based on historical data. The dataset used contains transactions labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent, enabling supervised learning.
This can be accomplished by do following steps:
## Steps:

1. **Collection of Data**
   - Gather the credit card transaction dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalize the data.
   - Handle class imbalance.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Understand the features and relationships between data.

4. **Train-Test Split**
   -  Spliting training data and testing data to evaluate the accuracy.

5. **Logistic Regression**
   - Train the model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

6. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision.
